Story: 3C in parking lot...venture into North Beach to Blazing Saddles for 8C outing, puzzlement of employees

Pro:

* Fun
* Comfortable (vs running: no impact; vs biking: butt, back, wrists)
* Hill climbing

Con:

* Bumpy ride
* Turning radius
* Price
* Heavy!
* Noisy (swish swish swish swish)

Interesting:

* Shift a lot more -- gears matter! Can't just "power up a hill"
* Quad-intensive
* What kind of shoes?
* Can't steer with your legs -- you need your hands, could barely control it with a single hand, much less none

Depends/unsure:

* More work for the same distance
* Center of attention
* Stride length (tunable?)
* Needed a tune-up
* Bike rack? Infrastructure.

Bottom line: all the faults are forgivable in the name of fun and exercise...except price. Want to sell me your used one?
