About a year ago, I saw someone riding an [ElliptiGO](http://www.elliptigo.com) near Dolores Park. I didn't know what it was, exactly, but I definitely wanted one. I always liked the elliptical trainers at the gym, and to get to ride one outdoors...perfection. In case you've never seen one, here's their promo video:

Then I found out how much they cost (spoiler: a *lot*), and that dampened my ardor.

When, a full year later, I was still boring my friends by obsessing over them, I figured I should actually take one out for a test ride.

First stop was [Precor Home Fitness in San Mateo](http://www.yelp.com/biz/precor-home-fitness-san-mateo). Alas, though they were very friendly, they only had a 3C to try (the bottom of the line), and they only let me ride it around in teeny tiny circus-bear circles in their fifteen foot parking lot.

Fortunately, [Blazing Saddles in San Francisco](http://www.blazingsaddles.com/san-francisco.aspx) rents ElliptiGOs -- or rather, one sole ElliptiGO 8C at their Fisherman's Wharf location, which they told me they bought on a whim, and which I was the first person ever to rent. So I summoned my fortitude and courage and went willingly into the dark, tourist-infested heart of Fisherman's Wharf. I even took the cable car there.

The Blazing Saddles staff milled about me, their normal routine disturbed. I didn't need directions to the Golden Gate bridge. I knew how to put on a helmet. They couldn't demonstrate how to ride it because they didn't know. Finally they gave up and just let me head out.

I rode for an hour and a half, covering 17 miles, including a steep, sustained climb from the Golden Gate bridge up to the lookout at the Nike Missile site.

The experience was entirely novel, so I found I actually needed three lists for this review: pros, cons, and flat out different.

Pros
----

  * _Fun_. It is just plain fun to ride. Part of that is no doubt novelty, but I'd wager it has serious lasting power.
  * _Different_. It is not biking. It is not running. It is definitely not swimming. And it's nice to have yet another way to get outside, get around, and get some exercise.
  * _Comfortable_. Biking a lot hurts my wrists, my back, and my prostate. Running a lot hurts my ankles and my feet. I suspect that a lot of time with the ElliptiGO might hurt my knees a bit, but my first experience was one of pure comfort.
  * _Hill climbing_. It's like rising out of the saddle to climb, but all the time, and comfortably. This thing was made for hills. I passed a lot of bicyclists in fancy gear going up the big hill in Marin.

Cons
----

  * _Bumpy ride_. I don't know whether it was the tiny wheel radius or the lack of shocks, but you could feel every last dime on the road, and on a particularly bad stretch of road near Crissy Field, it shook violently enough that I had to slow down to maintain control.
  * _Turning radius_. The ElliptiGO was not made for darting in and out of traffic like a bike messenger. It steers like a semi.
  * _Nowhere to rest_. On a bike, you can rest your legs by putting the pedals level with each other. There is no single "resting" position on the ElliptiGO -- at least one foot is always tilted or extended, forwards or backwards.
  * _Heavy_. 40-something pounds. TODO
  * _Loud_. With every stride, the runners make a noisy, mechanical swish.
  * _Tunability_. I don't know how fine-tunable the ElliptiGO is. The stride length felt a little short to me, and I didn't see any way to adjust it.
  * _Price_. $2500 for the model I tried. TODO. That's pricy, even compared to a good quality road bike. And based on my parking lot experience, I wouldn't consider dropping down to the 3C to save a couple hundred dollars. TODO

Different
---------

  * _Shifting matters_. Sometimes on a bike I just power up a hill without bothering to shift. Not so on the ElliptiGO. For any given speed and terrain, there is one and only one gear that is comfortable, so you shift much more frequently than on a bike.
  * _Quad intensive_. If you want to work our your quads, this is the way. On a bike with clips, you can get a lot more of your leg into the action. Clips don't make sense on an ElliptiGO.
  * _New_. By the end of the ride, I wasn't sure what shoes I would wear next time. (My running shoes felt clunky.) I wasn't sure how I would lock it in a bike rack. I wasn't sure how far 17 miles was in ElliptiGO terms. I wasn't sure how to give it a tune-up (and the rental needed one, particularly the derailleur), or where I could find an ElliptiGO mechanic in a pinch. I wasn't sure where I could buy replacement tires and tubes (the wheels are tiny!). Are there fenders for it? It's new and different.
  * _Fewer points of contact_. On a bike, I can steer for blocks without my hands. On an ElliptiGO, there's no saddle, which is wonderful -- good for butts, backs, wrists, and prostates -- but it means that your hands are critical for stability. With some practice, I could drop down to a single hand for a short period of time, but even that felt dicey.
  * _Efficiency_. In terms of effort-per-mile, I'd put the ElliptiGO between running and riding a mountain bike, although closer to the mountain bike. It means you can get a more intense workout more quickly, but also that it's not as good for covering lots of distance.
  * _Spectacle_. I was unquestionably the center of attention for my whole ride, even in incredibly busy, crowded Crissy Field. People complimented me, bikers did double-takes, cars slowed down to stare, and several people asked to try it out. They all came back with grins on their faces.

Bottom line
-----------

All the ElliptiGO's faults are overlookable in the name of fun and exercise...except price. It's just a lot of money to spend on a vehicle that still feels a bit rough around the edges. (It seems to me that most of the cons I listed ought to be addressable through design and manufacturing improvements.) And that's a pity, because I still really want one.
